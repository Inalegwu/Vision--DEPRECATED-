### Tech Stack
If you found your way to this github page , I assume you're interested in what Vision is built with.
Vision , is primarily an Electron app.I know what you're thinking , why an Electron app in the age of Tauri , the Rust powered 'Electron Killer' as the internet has named it.
Well primarily because I wanted to get Vision working as quickly as possible , because I also want to use it for my own comics.I also don't want to be battling Rust while also battling archiving and such and such.
Aside Electron, Vision is built with a lot of other things to , and has spawned it's own starter template [ElectroStatic](https://github.com/Inalegwu/ElectroStatic)

So what are the pieces in a nutshell ???

React: The primary UI Framework
<br>
Drizzle-ORM & Drizzle-Kit  : The ORM used for communicating with the storage layer
<br>
Better-SQLite3 : The SQLite Driver of choice
<br>
TRPC & Electron-TRPC : For communicating between the Renderer and Main process
<br>

This isn't an exhaustive list and other pieces of the template can be found in the project README , and if you find it interesting , consider giving it a star ðŸ˜‰

### What inspired Vision
Well, I wanted to read my comics again ,and in the country I'm from , comic books are outrageously expensive to get physically , so I settled on getting them digitally.
When time to actually read them came , I found the landscape of digital comics quite barren with only apps like CDDisplayEx and Cover scrapping by and not doing anything particularly innovative in my opinion , which is why I decided , Like all programmers do at some point , to build my own and make it better , which is why I tagged Vision <i>'the comic book reader from  the future'</i> because that's what I intend it to be


### Contributions
I'm still considering what Vision will turn out to be and as such , contributions are currently not open but you can watch the Repo , all news will be in the [discord server](https://discord.gg/dmKsRYHb)
